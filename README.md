# interactive-sketchfab-app
This repository is part of the Sketchfab tutorial to make an interactive app using a sketchfab model.
The tutorial is written for people who aren’t programmers and organizations who can’t afford programmers but want to be able to show their models in a much more interactive way. It doesn’t show you how to write your own code but it gives you an online full browser application to show complex models with lots of objects in it and a nice tab panel to put the accompanying text in it.
